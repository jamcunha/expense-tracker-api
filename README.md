# Expense Tracking App

## TODO: write the README

TODO: write tests for API instead of testing manually with curl

TODO: add expiration date of the JWT to the login response (learn better how to handle JWT)

TODO: uniformize the errors log (and what to send to the client)

TODO: add some kind of attempt limit to the login

#### Extra ideas

Check if there is an API to get data from bank accounts
